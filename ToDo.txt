- Add some basic information about monitoring and tracing to chapter 1
  (?) and create a crossreference from chapter 3 (example).

- Mention optimizations i.e. async communication in the control plane

- At the moment, the example chapter explains the circuit
  breaker. Should that stay this way or shall we change it?

- We could add the challenges, advantages, and conclusion that the
  "Practical Microservices" book mentions in chapter 23 to the
  conclusion.

- Maybe add something about "Service Meshes beyond microservices"?

- Add additional example to "Example" in the "How to Dig Deeper" section.
